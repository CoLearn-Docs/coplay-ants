## Getting Started

To get started with ESP32, you will need a development board, such as the ESP32 DevKitC or ESP32-CAM, as well as a USB cable and a computer with the
appropriate software installed.

You can install the software, such as [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software), which will allow you to write, upload and debug code on ESP32.

There are also other development platforms such as [ESP-IDF](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/get-started/index.html) and
[PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/) are also available.

Once you have your development board set up and your software installed, you can begin experimenting with ESP32 and its various capabilities.

There are many resources available online, including tutorials, sample code and forums to help you get started.
